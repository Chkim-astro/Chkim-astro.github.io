# About ME
- ðŸ”­ I'm a Ph.D student at*Astronomy and Space Science Department at Chungbuk National University.  <br />
- I'm majoring in High-Energy Astrophysics. **Pulsar Wind Nebulae**, **Supernova Remnants**  <br />
- I study Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) and Supernova Remnants (SNRs).  <br />
- My work includes developing SED models for PWNe.  <br />
